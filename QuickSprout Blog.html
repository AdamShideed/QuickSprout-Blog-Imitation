	<p class = "MainContent" style = "margin-top: 30px"><strong>Want to jump straight to the answer? The best online payroll service for most businesses is definitely QuickBooks Payroll.</strong></p>
	<p class = "MainContent">Historically, payroll has been one of the most complex elements of running a business. Business owners need to make sure that everyone is paid with 100% accuracy, including calculations related to taxes, benefits, and more.</p>
	<p class = "MainContent">How hard can it be? Well, about one-third of small businesses are fined by the IRS each year because of payroll mistakes.</p>
	<p class = "MainContent">But modern payroll solutions are changing. The days of faxing wage information to a payroll company and then manually passing out live checks to your employees are fading away.</p>
	<p class = "MainContent">Everyone wants direct deposit. More businesses are working with remote staff, freelancers, and independent contractors.</p>
	<p class = "MainContent">That’s why so many companies are switching to online payroll services.</p>
